## What to Contribute

**Issues:** Report bugs or request features using [GitHub issues][issues].

**Documentation:** You can send documentation changes via pull requests.

**Bug fixes:** You can send bug fixes via pull requests.

This project is a demo application for the [`gg-scm.io/pkg/git/packfile`][]
package so its scope is intentionally small. However, if there are small new
features, we may accept those as long as maintaining them does not introduce a
high cost.
